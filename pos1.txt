in november we will not have to imagine it! it will be a reality
isn't healthy enough to be her goons are trying to strong arm the media into not speaking of it.
is this supposed to be " profound "? and what is up with your goofy eyes?
it's ok for blacks to say they are all persecuted... but not ok for to agree?
it was your people who bowed and gave them 400m + to act this way.
i would give it back to the people it was originally stolen from and let people spend it as they see fit.
keep ur head up girl. when the devil tries 2 destroy u, then god will lift you up. you have had 2 overcome many tough hurdles.
kill ur self. you are a liar and a killer
lied lost national security info lied left americans to die lied armed isis lied... oh wait, that was you
lies you cant hide from the words that are written in the emails, your day is coming, and dems cant do anything about it.
like you for example who created no child left behind while every state has pulled major funding from every public school
loses 12 pts in 10 days in the polls. maybe she should hold a press conference to talk about it.
made her share of gold star families already. we do not need her making any more.
make sure to get all those illegal immigrants too so you actually have a chance

like get your molester off the charges, or ruin your life for telling the truth about my husband
are you the same scumbag you were 40 years ago. oh i guess so rape a woman hillary will laugh about getting you off.
said the bitch who pays women working for her, less than the men working for men.
she got screwed her life will b full of minipulation from hillary. the legos is a slamming deal...
she's a maniac, maniac on the floor and she's dancing like she's never danced before
simple we know you are a lying criminal who only seeks for self. america needs a leader, not you.
so let's give the button to a brain-damaged drunk whose eyes point in different directions! that makes sense!

you need to remind people of ur intention to raise taxes everywhere especially rich.
wants a normal election because she's been checking the boxes since senate. the ppl do not want normal, need drastic change.
was going to invite all the people screwed over to the but there were not enough seats available.
" we can not trust the american people to make these types of choices. the government has to make choices for them " -hrc
we've read the emails & your crimes are worse of any i've seen! i would not vote for you if you offered me a million dollars!
what part is inaccurate or misleading... their status has stayed unchanged in fact worse. nobody wants hand outs
where do you fall on the curve of presidents who are considered honest and trustworthy?
who allows prime time spot light on a guys father who killed lots of people. we want coverage for days nonstop on this
why is it inner-city leaders are vastly democrat? would it be that people like someone that does not try to stop the violence
