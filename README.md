# sarcasm-detector-by-CNN
It predicts a given statement is sarcastic or not. <br/>
It uses neural network made of Convolutional1D layers, maxpooling, dropout and pretained GloVe embeddings in Embedding layer at first.<br/>
GloVe word embeddings can be downloaded at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ <br/>
I used this one : http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip (6B tokens, 400K vocab, uncased, 50d, 100d, 200d, & 300d vectors, 822 MB download) <br/>
Little data precessing is done to make data cleaner.
